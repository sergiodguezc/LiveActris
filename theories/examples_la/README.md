# LinearActris Examples
This folder contains examples taken from the LinearActris framework (Linear
Actris Artifact. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8422755). They
illustrate that LiveActris is still expressive enough to capture most of the
useful examples from LinearActris. Some of the proofs have been adapted, since
we have restrict the use of Lob's rule in LiveActris. However, the main ideas
of the proofs remain the same.
